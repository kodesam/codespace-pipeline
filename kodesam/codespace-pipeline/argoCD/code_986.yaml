I apologize for the confusion. Since I am an AI text-based assistant, I don't have the capability to execute or re-run code directly. However, you can take the provided Jinja template and save it as a YAML file with a `.yaml` or `.yml` extension. Then, you can apply the YAML file using the `kubectl` command-line tool.

Assuming you have the `kubectl` command-line tool properly installed and configured to communicate with your OpenShift cluster, you can apply the YAML file using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f <path/to/your/file.yaml>
```

Replace `<path/to/your/file.yaml>` with the actual file path of the YAML file you saved. This will deploy the resources defined in the YAML file to your OpenShift cluster.

Please note that any changes made to your existing resources may require you to delete the existing resources before re-applying the updated YAML file. You can delete the resources using the `kubectl delete` command.

```bash
kubectl delete -f <path/to/your/file.yaml>
```

Again, replace `<path/to/your/file.yaml>` with the actual file path of the YAML file.

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create, update, and delete resources in your OpenShift environment.

I hope this clarifies the process for applying the YAML file. Let me know if you have any further questions.
