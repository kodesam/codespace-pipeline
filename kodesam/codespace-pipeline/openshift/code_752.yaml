Here is an example of creating an OpenShift deployment pod, services, secrets, configmap, and routes using a Kubernetes YAML file:

1. Create a YAML file named `openshift-deployment.yaml` and add the following content:

```yaml
# Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: glueapp
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: glueapp
  replicas: 4
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: glueapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: nginx:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          volumeMounts:
            - name: secret-volume
              mountPath: /etc/my-app/secret
            - name: configmap-volume
              mountPath: /etc/my-app/config
      volumes:
        - name: secret-volume
          secret:
            secretName: my-secret
        - name: configmap-volume
          configMap:
            name: my-configmap

# Services
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: glueapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: glueapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80

# Secrets
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  password: base64encodedpassword

# ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-configmap
data:
  app.properties: |
    key1=value1
    key2=value2

# Routes
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: glueapp-route
spec:
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: glueapp-service
  port:
    targetPort: 80
```

2. Save the file and apply it using the following command:

```bash
oc apply -f openshift-deployment.yaml
```

This will create an OpenShift deployment pod with 4 replicas, a service, a secret, a configmap, and a route for accessing the application.

Make sure to replace the values in the YAML file with your desired values.
