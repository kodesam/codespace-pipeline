Here is an example of a Kubernetes YAML file to create a Deployment with 3 ReplicaSets:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: your_image
          ports:
            - containerPort: your_container_port
```

In the above YAML file, replace `my-deployment`, `my-app`, `your_image`, and `your_container_port` with the appropriate values for your Deployment.

You can apply this YAML file using the `kubectl` command-line tool by running the command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

This will create a Deployment named `my-deployment` with 3 ReplicaSets, each running a container with the specified image and port.
