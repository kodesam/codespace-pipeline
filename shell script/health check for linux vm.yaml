Sure, here's an example of a basic health check script for a Linux VM:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check CPU usage
cpu_usage=$(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2 + $4}')
echo "CPU Usage: $cpu_usage%"

# Check memory usage
mem_usage=$(free -m | awk 'NR==2{printf "%.2f%%", $3*100/$2 }')
echo "Memory Usage: $mem_usage"

# Check disk usage
disk_usage=$(df -h | awk '$NF=="/"{printf "%s", $5}')
echo "Disk Usage: $disk_usage"

# Check network connectivity
ping -c 3 google.com &> /dev/null
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Internet connectivity: Connected"
else
  echo "Internet connectivity: Disconnected"
fi

# Check SSH connectivity
ssh_status=$(systemctl is-active ssh)
echo "SSH connectivity: $ssh_status"

# Add more health checks as needed

```

You can save this script to a file, for example `health_check.sh`, on your Linux VM. Then, you can execute the script to perform the health check. The script will display the CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, network connectivity, and SSH connectivity.

Note that this script uses various Linux command-line utilities, such as `top`, `free`, `df`, `ping`, and `systemctl`. Make sure these utilities are available on your Linux VM for the script to work correctly.

You can modify this script or add additional health checks based on your specific requirements or preferences.
