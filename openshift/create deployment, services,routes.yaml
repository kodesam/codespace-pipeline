Here is an example YAML code for creating a deployment, service, and route in Ansible:

```yaml
---
- name: Create deployment, service, and route
  k8s:
    state: present
    definition:
      kind: Deployment
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      metadata:
        name: siteq-deployment
      spec:
        replicas: 3
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app: siteq
        template:
          metadata:
            labels:
              app: siteq
          spec:
            containers:
              - name: nginx
                image: nginx:latest
                ports:
                  - containerPort: 80

- name: Create service
  k8s:
    state: present
    definition:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
        name: siteq-service
      spec:
        selector:
          app: siteq
        ports:
          - name: http
            port: 80
            targetPort: 80
        type: ClusterIP

- name: Create route
  k8s:
    state: present
    definition:
      apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
      kind: Route
      metadata:
        name: siteq-route
      spec:
        host: your-hostname.com
        to:
          kind: Service
          name: siteq-service
```

You can save this YAML code in a file, for example `deploy_siteq.yaml`, and run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```
ansible-playbook deploy_siteq.yaml
```

Make sure to replace `your-hostname.com` with your desired hostname for the route.
